# Self Learning LLMs

This repository constitutes some of the resources which I will use to learn about Large Language Models. I will also try to come up with a roadmap as I go forward in this self-learning journey, since a clear roadmap with milestones will be one of the best ways to learn about LLMs in a proper manner.

For this, I will include a mix of theoretical plus practical resources to learn.

## LLM Influencers 

*People you should definitely follow to keep updated about LLMs. Researchers/Founders/Developers/AI Content Creators involved in LLM production/research/development*

1. [Sebastian Raschka](https://twitter.com/rasbt), he is a legend and will burst your hype-up LLM bubble with his amazing tweets, blogs and tutorials. Subscribe to his newsletter [Ahead of AI](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/)
2. [Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy), so this legend worked in Tesla, took a break, started his YouTube channel to teach the fundamentals and blew us all with his amazing video on [implementing GPT from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=2771s) and finally rejoined OpenAI. I guess you cannot lose a legend :D  
3. [Jay Alammar](https://twitter.com/jayalammar), yup if you don't know about his ELI blog on Transformers go read that out first and be sure to follow him for updates.
4. [Tomaz Bratanic](https://twitter.com/tb_tomaz), he is the author of famous book Graph Algorithms for Data Science, and currently writes great blogs on Medium related to GPT, Langchain and stuff.
