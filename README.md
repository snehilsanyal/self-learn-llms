# Self Learning LLMs

This repository constitutes some of the resources which I will use to learn about Large Language Models. I will also try to come up with a roadmap as I go forward in this self-learning journey, since a clear roadmap with milestones will be one of the best ways to learn about LLMs in a proper manner.

For this, I will include a mix of theoretical plus practical resources to learn.
